Electroteca proposes a policy-driven lending model that combines institutional management where universities publish and govern their own inventories with verified peer contributions, where individuals can list devices and earn credits when those devices are borrowed. The platform comprises a secure web application with catalog and search, reservations, check-out and check-in, reminders and messaging and essential safety controls such as user verification, condition logging, and calibration records.
